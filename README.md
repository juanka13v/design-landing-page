# CW - Test Landing Page

This is a test landing page for a fictitious company specializing in web design, UX/UI, branding, and product design. The purpose of this landing page is to showcase the company's services and provide an overview of their expertise in the field.

## Additional Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is built with responsive design principles, ensuring it adapts and displays properly on various devices and screen sizes. Whether your visitors are using desktops, tablets, or mobile phones, the layout and content will adjust accordingly for an optimal viewing experience.

- **Responsive Slider**: The landing page includes a responsive slider component that allows you to showcase multiple images or highlight key features. The slider is designed to automatically adjust its size and appearance based on the device screen, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience for your users.

- **Scroll Spy**: To enhance navigation and user experience, the landing page incorporates a scroll spy functionality. As users scroll through the page, the navigation menu highlights the corresponding section, providing clear visual feedback and making it easy for visitors to identify their current position on the page.
